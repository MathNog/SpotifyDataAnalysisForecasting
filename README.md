## About this Project

This project was developed as part of the final assignment for the course **INF1032 â€“ Introduction to Data Science** at PUC-Rio. It explores the characteristics of popular songs using Spotify data and applies predictive modeling to estimate a track's likelihood of entering the Top 200 charts and the number of streams it may receive.

The dataset was constructed using Spotifyâ€™s Web API and Spotify Charts (Top 200) across multiple countries. The project includes both **descriptive analytics** and **predictive modeling**.

## Key Insights and Objectives

### Descriptive Analysis
- Compared audio features of top-charting songs across different regions (Global, Brazil, USA, India, Mexico, Germany).
- Tracked the evolution of musical characteristics over time.
- Assessed the prevalence of native-language songs in national Top 200 rankings.
- Identified potentially anomalous songs using an ensemble of outlier detection models.
- Investigated which song attributes most influence popularity.

### Predictive Modeling

1. **Classification**
   - Predict whether a song will enter the Global Top 200 based on its features and metadata.
   - Models used: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
   - Variants explored:
     - With/without artist-related features
     - PCA with 5 components
     - Filtering out anomalies
   - Best result (Random Forest with anomaly filtering):
     - Accuracy: 0.90  
     - Precision: 0.91  
     - Recall: 0.92  

2. **Regression**
   - Predict the number of streams a song will receive based on its characteristics.
   - Models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
   - Tested using raw features and PCA-transformed data.

### Anomaly Detection Ensemble
- Combined results from ABOD, Autoencoders, Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor.
- Final anomaly labels obtained via weighted averaging of model outputs.
- Helped interpret outliers and refine datasets for predictive models.

## Notes

- Code was developed using Google Colab, with file paths linked to shared Google Drive directories. Execution outside that environment may require adjustments.
- Data collection and model tuning steps (e.g., Spotify API queries, grid search) may require significant runtime.
- This repository includes only work related to the second half of the course (G2).
